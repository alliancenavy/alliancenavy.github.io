<h2>Our History</h2>

<p>The Alliance Navy was first founded in 2005 in Second Life’s sandbox regions, when a number of like-minded individuals bonded over their love of sci-fi, and joined together to cooperate in building giant spaceships using the in-game tools available at the time.</p>

<p>The huge capital ships attracted quite a bit of attention, and the group quickly spread into different different areas of interest and expertise as new members joined and diversified the group’s mission. These included not just ship building, but infantry, armored, and aerial combat.</p>

<p>Once the AN set up a permanent base in the world, rival groups took our lead and within a year, this formed into what would be known as the “Second Life Military Community”. The AN considered itself a leading member of Second Life’s combat community for more than a decade.</p>

<p>All this was possible through the talents of the group’s engineers, who built complex vehicles, tools, and weapons systems by pushing the limits of the platform’s in-game coding language and building systems.</p>

<p>While many of the Alliance Navy’s members were just teenagers in these early years, a number went on to adulthood and built hobbies and careers out of the skills they first developed in the Alliance Navy, including software development, 3D modelling, game design, sound design, server administration, and the real-world military.</p>
